"""
Problem: Given the head of a LinkedList with a cycle, find the length of the cycle.

Solution: Once the fast and slow pointers meet, we can save the slow pointer and iterate the whole cycle with another pointer until we see the slow pointer again to find the length of the cycle.

Difficulty: Easy
