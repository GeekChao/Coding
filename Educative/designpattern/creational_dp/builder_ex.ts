/**
 * Problem: 
 * The task here is to implement the builder pattern to create an assignment. 
 * Each assignment is of a subject: it has a level, which means it is either easy, medium, or hard.
 * It also has a due date. The announcement function given to you displays all this information. 
 * You have to figure out where to put this functionâ€™s definition and how to build the assignment step-by-step.
